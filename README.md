# Kidney Stones in Urinal Analysis

## Feature Explanation

* Gravity : This characteristic shows the pee's specific gravity, which is a gauge of the amount of dissolved matter present in the urine. A higher specific gravity can be a sign of dehydration or a high level of minerals in the urine, which may help kidney stones form.

* pH : The pH indicator shows how acidic the urine is. The pH of the urine can change depending on things like diet and medication, and having high or low pH levels can cause different kinds of kidney stones to form.

* Osmo : This characteristic denotes the osmolarity of urine, which is a gauge of the solute concentration in urine. Dehydration or a high concentration of minerals in the urine, both of which might promote the production of kidney stones, can be indicated by high osmolarity.

* Calc : The calcium content of the urine is shown by the Calc feature. Kidney stones frequently contain calcium, and having a lot of calcium in your urine might cause calcium-based stones to form.

* Cond : The conductivity of urine, which is a gauge of how strongly pee conducts electrical current, is represented by this characteristic. Excessive mineral content in the urine, which can facilitate kidney stone formation, may be indicated by high conductivity.

* Urea : The amount of urea in the urine is indicated by this attribute. The kidneys filter urea out of the blood, and it is then eliminated in urine. Increased kidney stone risk may be caused by renal malfunction or dehydration, which can be shown by high urea levels in urine.

* TARGET : Indicating if a patient has kidney stone or not!
